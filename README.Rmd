The flextable package provides a framework for easily create tables for 
reporting and publications. Tables can be easily formatted with 
a set of verbs such as `bold()`, `color()`, they can receive a 
header of more than one line, cells can be merged or contain 
an image. The package make it possible to build any table for 
publication from a `data.frame`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
set_flextable_defaults(
  font.family = "Arial", font.size = 10, 
  border.color = "gray")

flextable(head(cars)) %>% 
  bold(part = "header") %>% 
  add_footer_lines("The 'cars' dataset")
```


Tables can be embedded within HTML, PDF, Word and PowerPoint documents 
from R Markdown documents and within Microsoft Word or PowerPoint 
documents with package officer. Tables can also be rendered as R plots 
or graphic files (png, pdf and jpeg).

```{r eval=FALSE}
flextable(mtcars) %>% 
  theme_vanilla() %>% 
  save_as_docx(path = "mytable.docx")
```




A `flextable` object is a data.frame representation. An API is available to let R users create tables for reporting and control their formatting properties and their layout. The package provides functions that give control over:

- header, body and footer content 
- text, paragraphs, cells and border formatting of any element
- displayed values

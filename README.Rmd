The flextable package provides a framework for easily create tables for 
reporting and publications. Tables can be easily formatted with 
a set of verbs such as `bold()`, `color()`, they can receive a 
header of more than one line, cells can be merged or contain 
an image. The package make it possible to build any table for 
publication from a `data.frame` and provides sugar function 
`as_flextable()` to convert several R objects to a flextable,
such as an object return from `table()` or a model.

Tables can be embedded within HTML, PDF, Word and PowerPoint documents 
from R Markdown documents and within RTF or Microsoft Word or PowerPoint 
documents with package officer. Tables can also be rendered as R plots 
or graphic files (png).

  save_as_docx(path = "mytable.docx")
```


A `flextable` object is a data.frame representation. An API is available to let
R users create tables for reporting and control their formatting properties and
their layout. The package provides functions that give control over:

- header, body and footer content 
- text, paragraphs, cells and border formatting of any element
- displayed values

The package also offers a set of high-level functions that allow tabular
reporting of statistical models and the creation of complex cross tabulations.

## Examples


```{r 'mtcars-dataset', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(flextable)
set_flextable_defaults(
  font.family = "Arial", font.size = 10, 
  border.color = "gray", big.mark = "")

ft <- flextable(head(mtcars)) |> 
  bold(part = "header") 
ft

ft |> 
  highlight(i = ~ mpg < 22, j = "disp", color = "#ffe842") |> 
  bg(j = c("hp", "drat", "wt"), 
     bg = scales::col_quantile(palette = c("wheat", "red"), domain =NULL)) |> 
  add_footer_lines("The 'mtcars' dataset")
```


```{r 'diamonds-dataset'}
ggplot2::diamonds[, c("cut", "carat", "price", "clarity", "table")] |> 
  summarizor(by = c("cut")) |> 
  as_flextable(spread_first_col = TRUE)
```
